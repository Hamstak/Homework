/*
	Write the BraveKnight class in its entirety.
	It must do the following:
	0) Inherit from Knight
	   2 points
	1) Declare a private field to represent the count
	   of slain enemies.
		2 points
	2) Write a constructor that takes a parameter based on
	   the call in the Tester.  You must call the super
		class constructor to initialize the name and bravery index.
		Specify the braveryIndex based on the output from the Tester.
		5 points
	3) Write the attack method.  The brave knight's attack
		always slays the enemy.  The attack method needs to
		report this based on the output you see from the Tester
		5 points
	4) Override the toString method and add to the behavior
	   provided by the Knight class' toString to include
		the count of enemies slain.  Look at the output produced
		from the tester for formatting.
