/*
	Write a recursive solution to the pow method.
	It accepts two parameters, a double that represents
	the base followed by an int that represents an exponent.
	The method returns a double.
	
	A stubbed out public pow method signature is provided for you.
	Write the *PRIVATE* recursive helper method(s) necessary to
	accomplish your task and call as necessary from
	the stubbed out public method (which is NOT recursive).
	
	HINTS:
	
	-any value to the power of 0 is 1 (even 0 for our intents)
	-2^1 is 2
	-2^2 is 2*2 OR 2*2^1
	-2^3 is 2*2*2 OR 2*2^2
	-certainly any negative exponent is just:
	   1/(positive pow result)
		
	NOTE: If you do not productively use recursion exclusively to solve
	this problem, you will receive little or no credit.
